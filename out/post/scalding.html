<ul>
<li>Scalding is an abstraction on top of Cascading, which is written in Java, and it inherits a lot of its data structures, including <code>Flow</code></li>
<li>The match+case pattern works really well instead of two separate steps with a map and filter
TypedPipes are the main unit of work in Scalding. They can be most any type. Think of them as a distributed List or Array.</li>
<li>TypedPipes fork in order to both write to a file and for use further downstream in a program</li>
<li>Writing intermediate files to test is important</li>
<li>Always filter as early as possible in the process so youâ€™re not churning through a lot of data</li>
<li>Make sure to specify a default amount of reducers</li>
</ul>
