<ul>
<li>Most variables should be <code>val</code>, immutable by default, and very rarely will you use <code>var</code></li>
<li>Scala tuples canâ€™t hold more than 22 values</li>
<li>If you have more than 22 fields, consider using a <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/case-classes.html">case class</a>, a class that contains immutable fields and their type definitions</li>
<li><a href="https://ammonite.io/">Ammonite</a> is a great tool for interactively working with small Scala scripts, POCs, and for seeing what methods any given object can have</li>
<li>Option[T] represents a value that may/may not exist; Some[v:T]</li>
<li>Scala likes to use T, V, and K as the main variable/class representation variables</li>
<li>Options are often used instead of nulls, Options include Some/None. This makes it easy to do getOrElse, which substitutes an alternative value if Option is None.</li>
</ul>
